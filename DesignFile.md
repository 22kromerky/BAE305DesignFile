#Summary#
For our project in BAE 305, our group collaborated with a professor in the Horticulture Department, in order to design and build two different systems. The work was done in collaboration with Dr. Brent Arnoldussen. The two systems created were a TEM tray and an Ejector system. For the first system, the idea of the build was to create a tray that could read the critical temperature at which different fruit buds died off at. When a plant bud dies, it releases an electrical impulse than can be seen using voltage readers. For our project, we used TEM (look up name and add) plates to take the reading of when the bud dies. We were able to make a tray of TEM plates that were stored in mint cans and riveted onto the tray, with the tray holding 14 trays along with a reference tray. This system will be placed in the freezer that Dr. Arnoldussen has in lab, which will allow him to run experiments to find when the critical temperature is reached for the buds in each mint can. There is a DAQ logger that allows for storing of the data collection. 
  For the second sytem, the ejector system, the purpose of this system was to be able to eject a canister that is filled with a plant specimen, at a temperature gradient that is chosen by the user. This system included a column that allows for holding of up to 10 canisters, and ejectors built out of solenoids that will allow the canister to be ejected via a vending machine style door. The ejector system will allow the user to eject canisters over a long period of time at different temperature setpoints to see how the plant specimens react to different temperatures. 
  Another part of this project included fabrication of a vending machine style door. This included a drawing design of the proposed door, which was then taken to the shop and fabricated with a flap at the bottom to mimmick a vending machine. 
  After testing our two systems, there were some very successful results. For the DAQ and TEM system, we were able to successfully collect and store voltage data on an excel file for an 18 hour test period. After mutliple test runs, we were able to rewire and get the system to work correctly, with a successful run exporting the data to an excel file. For the ejector system, we were able to successfully eject 10 canisters startign at 10 degrees celsius, and ejecting a canister every one degree celsius drop until the final temperature reached zero.
