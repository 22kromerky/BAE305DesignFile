# Summary
For our project in BAE 305, our group collaborated with a professor in the Horticulture Department, in order to design and build two different systems. The work was done in collaboration with Dr. Brent Arnoldussen. The two systems created were a TEM tray and an Ejector system. For the first system, the idea of the build was to create a tray that could read the critical temperature at which different fruit buds died off at. When a plant bud dies, it freezes inside and the heat of fusion of the ice can casue a voltage spike on TEMs. For our project, we used TEM (thermo-electric module) plates to take the reading of when the bud dies. We were able to make a tray of TEM plates that were stored in mint cans and riveted onto the tray, with the tray holding 14 trays along with a reference tray. This system will be placed in the freezer that Dr. Arnoldussen has in lab, which will allow him to run experiments to find when the critical temperature is reached for the buds in each mint can. There is a DAQ logger that allows for storing of the data collection. 
  For the second sytem, the ejector system, the purpose of this system was to be able to eject a canister that is filled with a plant specimen, at a temperature gradient that is chosen by the user. This system included a column that allows for holding of up to 10 canisters, and ejectors built out of solenoids that will allow the canister to be ejected via a vending machine style door. The ejector system will allow the user to eject canisters over a long period of time at different temperature setpoints to see how the plant specimens react to different temperatures. 
  Another part of this project included fabrication of a vending machine style door. This included a drawing design of the proposed door, which was then taken to the shop and fabricated with a flap at the bottom to mimmick a vending machine. 
  After testing our two systems, there were some very successful results. For the DAQ and TEM system, we were able to successfully collect and store voltage data on an excel file for an 18 hour test period. After mutliple test runs, we were able to rewire and get the system to work correctly, with a successful run exporting the data to an excel file. For the ejector system, we were able to successfully eject 10 canisters startign at 10 degrees celsius, and ejecting a canister every one degree celsius drop until the final temperature reached zero. 

# Design Description
  For our design of the TEM system, we were given a parts list from a previous build of this project to work off of. We needed insulated metal cans to hold the TEMs so we drilled holes for the wires in mintboxes and riveted them to a perforated aluminum sheet. We filled them with insulating foam and then ran the wires for the TEMs through the mintboxes and the holes in the sheet so we could hook them up to connectors on the bottom of the tray. We needed to connect all of them to our DAQ(Keithley DAQ 6510) for data acquisition, and we used a multiplexer(Keithely 7700) to increase the amount of channels for the DAQ. The TEMs came with two wires, which we screwed directly into the pin side of 8-pin-to-female ethernet connectors. The thermistor we sautered to extra wire to screw into the connector. On the other side of the connector we plugged in 4 CAT-6 cables that we had crimped. These cables ran to our multiplexer where the twisted pairs were pulled out of the cable and screwed into channels 121-135 on our multiplexer. We had some issues with crimping but they were ultimately resolved. Another issue was making sure all of the channels were connected to the appropriate TEMs, which was a matter of labelling and color-coding with the wires that came out of the CAT-6.

The other project, controlled freezing and ejection, involved much more hardware. We had to work witt the shop to fabricate an insulated door that could be screwed onto the freezer and had an ejection flap like a vending machine. For the ejector column, we used the perforated aluminum sheet to make walls that would go into our freezer. We got test tube racks, since they were rectangular, hollow, and the right dimensions, and we screwed them into the walls. We configured a sideways V-shaped ramp, with cans(PVC for demonstration purposes) being loaded at the top, rolling back at an angle, dropping down to a second ramp, and rolling up to the front. Having this cutback increased the amount of cans that we could fit but ended up being a huge headache as the corner became a point where we had a lot of jams. For our improved, more permanent drawings of the system we have replaced it with a continuous curve to resolve this. 
  	We had two solenoids bracketed onto our test-tube racks with holes drilled so they could poke into the tube. We had one on top and one on bottom, spaced about the width of a can, and oriented in opposite directions. This way, when we sent a signal to fire both, one in the front would pull up and let the can behind it roll. Meanwhile the one behind it would push up and stop the other cans from rolling out with it. We had both solenoids wired to an external power supply on the ground end. Their positive ends were sautered together and we had a wire running into mechanical relays in the top of our fridge. These relays would act as a switch and be controlled by a program running on the freezer controller. We connected the power supply to the other end of the relay, creating a circuit. When the relay closed, the solenoids had power and would fire, and when the relay was off there was no circuit. We could adjust the temperature set points and on-time for the relays in a program on the WATLOW F4T controller on the freezer.

# Design Decision Discussion

One of the most important considerations for the TEM tray was noise control. Since the heat of fusion of ice inside a dying seed is a very small electrical signal, it was important to be able to consistently pick up millivolt readings that were accurate. Our design was based on one from Washington that our stakeholder had worked on himself, and he had used a DB-37 connecter and sautered all the tem wires into one connector on his tray. We decided to use CAT-6 as it was significantly easier to work with and the twisted pairs would help with noise control. This made labelling the connectors incredibly important, as there were now 4 connectors per tray, but the convenience and quality was ultimately worth it. We also had to decide on how to do connectors and the 8-pin turned out to be the easiest way, as running CAT-6 to each TEM and then crimping on that side would have required us to solder the TEM wires and there was concern that they were not  a good material to solder onto. 
	For the ejector column, we decided to use test-tube racks, since that was what was used in the previous iteration of the project, although we had little to no information on the ejector to go off. But since they were basically already the shape that we wanted, we decided to use the racks instead of fabricating the columns from scratch. This was probably our biggest point of issues, as it was hard to attach the walls and solenoids to the plastic and we ended up getting the shop to screw it on. We then had issues with getting the solenoids to actually stop the cans, spacing them properly and getting the right clearance on the inside of the column. Deciding to have two rectangular ramps, with a drop at the corner in between was a mistake as we had several jams there. The only other thing that was really up in the air was how to configure the solenoids, but using two, one pushing and one pulling simultaneously, was the only thing we came up with that we felt sure would work. 

# Testing Description

In order to test our TEM system we ran 18 hours collecting data every five minutes to test the DAQ data logging. Afterwards, we tested each cable connection individually with a multimeter on either end of all the connections. We also tested each TEM with a multimeter to show it was picking up voltages for temp. We then did the same with the DAQ, pressing our hands on each TEM and making sure the DAQ was picking up the voltage change. We then ran several short tests to make sure all of our data was consistent and noise controlled.
	For testing the ejector column, we set up our freezer and door and ran several tests with different set points, from 15 degrees all the way down to -10, and made sure that it was ejecting at the appropriate temperatures.


# Test Results
During the testing phase of this project, each component included in the deliverables functioned as intended. The ejector component operated correctly, releasing a single pod once the designated temperature was reached. The solenoids activated and deactivated appropriately, allowing one pod to roll out while preventing the others from following. It should be noted, however, that the ejector columns are still in the prototype stage, and the pods - constructed from PVC pipe - lacked sufficient weight for optimal performance.

In addition to the ejector, we fabricated a vending machine door to allow the pods to pass through. The primary issue encountered was that the PVC pipe lacked the proper weight to push the fabricated door open; the pods often also rotated and became stuck. To address these issues, we have already begun designing an improved version with sturdier pods that possess enough weight to smoothly pass through the door.
 
 Finally, the TEM system performed as expected. 14 trays successfully monitored voltage, while a reference tray - embedded with a 10 kÎ© thermistor accurately recorded ambient temperature. To verify the tray's voltage monitoring capability, we applied a heat source (a hand) and initiated a scan using the DAQ6510. Upon contact, the voltage spiked from microvolts to millivolts, then gradually returned to baseline once the heat source was removed. For long-term testing, we programmed the DAQ 6510 to conduct repeated scans at 5-minute intervals over 18 hours. After leaving the system running overnight, we obtained an Excel sheet confirming the successful completion of the scan.


# Testing Results Discussion
For our first system, the TEM plates, the capability of this sytstem is to be able to collect data over a specified period of time relating to the voltage read from a TEM plate, to be able to find the critical temperature at which a plant bud dies at. This system will allow a user to conduct experiments in which they want to test up to 14 plant buds and read the voltage values for any specified period of time and any specified number of times during the trial period. This data that is gathered is stored in the DAQ (Data Acquisition) and can then be exported to a third-party application such as excel for storing the data. This design would be used in research labs to gather valuable data on different plants to find out in which climates the plants can successfully survive. During the testing period, the system was able to successfully export the data for a test period of 18 hours. We did run into some problems. For one, during the first trial runs, we realized the multiplexer was wired wrong with the cat6 cables, and had to be completely rewired in order to get the system to work. The system ast first was just reading a correct voltage, but then at the next collection point, was reading basically zero voltage, and this pattern continued for most of the channels except for four, which caused us to use a multimeter to check the connections and find out the problem was the multiplexer connections needed to be rewired. Overall, at the end of the testing stage the system worked as expected, and also worked as was expected by Dr. Arnoldussen, who the system was made for. Some of the limitations included the design of the tray and the placing of the cables under the tray that connected to the multiplexer. We ran out of time, but we still needed to cut out a space in the tray to hold the connector cables, since the way they are currently ziptied sticks out of the fridge. In addition, due to a poor crimping tool, the cat6 connections at some points will not be fully working, in which the user must recrimp the cat6 cables. Overall, this system can successfully collect voltage data from TEM plates and export that data into an excel sheet. The only limitations are the amount, as we can only collected 14 samples at a time. 
	For the second system, the ejector system that ejects canisters at a specified temperature gradient, the system was overall successful for the mosty part. This system after the testing period, can successfully hold more than 10 canisters that will be filled with various plant material. The canisters are held in a column that is sloped for easy release out of the fridge. In addition, the system can successfully allow one canister to be dispensed out of the fridge, while catching the next canister and holding it in place. This will allow for a singular canister to be dispensed at a temperature gradient, such as starting from 0 degrees celsius, and dispensing a canister at each celsius drop until all of the canisters have been dispensed. This design would work in a research setting, in which a researcher wants to test diffrent plant materials and their responses to different temperature changes. This data could be used to see how the plant material reacts to different temperature changes, mimicking the growing season. Overall, the system works well, but there are some limitations to the system. For one, when the canisters stack up as they are on two downward slopes that meet, the canisters sometimes become stuck, which will not allow for the canister to be properly dispensed. Also, as this design was only a prototype (the real version is shown in the cad file that will be a metal column) there was jamming due to using metal cans to try and stop the jamming from occurring. Therefore, while overall the system works as intended sometimes, it does have the ability to jam, which will stop the dispensing of canisters from happening as expected at the temperature gradient. Overall, the prototype worked for the most part, but more design needs to be done on the metal column in order to successfully get the system to work 100% of the time. 
 	Another part of the ejector system was the vending-machine style door that was fabricated. This allows for the dispensing of the canisters via a flap that is like a vending machine, along with the door being insulated. This design would work with the ejector system, replacing the regular fridge door, to allow the canisters to fall out into a collection box. This door was fabricated to the exact dimensions, for easy replacement of the old door, just by unscrewing the old door and screwing in the new door as it uses the same hinges and same handle. It works well, but there are some limitations. One limitation, is the pvc pipe used for the canisters does not carry enough weight to move the flap sometimes, which just keeps the canister sitting in the bottom of the fridge, and not fully dispensing. Another limitation, is the vending machine door flap is completely flat, which makes it hard for the canisters to roll out of the flap, causing the same issue described above. Therefore, overall, the system works well, but at some times it does not successfully allow the canisters to roll out of the flap and into the collection box under the fridge.
